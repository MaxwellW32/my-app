            <br />
            Our journey began with a small food stand in a local market, where
            we quickly gained a reputation for our delicious dishes and
            affordable prices. As word spread about our amazing food, we
            expanded to a full-fledged restaurant in the heart of Jamaica.
            <br />
            <br />
            Today, we continue to grow and innovate, while staying true to our
            roots. We believe that great food shouldn't have to break the bank,
            and we work hard to keep our prices affordable without compromising
            on quality.
            <br />
            <br />
            We're grateful to our loyal customers who have supported us on this
            journey, and we strive to make every dining experience at Little
            Lemon a memorable one. So whether you're a regular or a first-time
            visitor, we look forward to welcoming you with open arms and serving
